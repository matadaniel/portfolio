## Very Experienced:

I design production grade [<ReactJs /> React](https://reactjs.org/) applications. Using the [<Nextdotjs /> Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, I am able to quickly build static and dynamic websites and web applications. It also enables me to fetch data and render content in different ways (SSR, SSG, CSR, ISR), easily optimize images and fonts, create pages on top of a file-system based router, and much more. I use [<Typescript /> TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) throughout my code to ensure type safety and catch errors through my editor instead of through user complaints.

I use [<Sass /> Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to create scalable stylesheets with superpowers. Sass is a preprocessor that adds many features to CSS (nesting, modules, mixins, operators, and more). I write stylesheets in SCSS syntax, a superset of CSS, which means all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well.

## Some Experience:
