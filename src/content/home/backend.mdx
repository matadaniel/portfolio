## Very Experienced:

### EVM

I use [<Solidity /> Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) to write smart contracts. My main focus while writing smart contracts is the safety of the users' funds. To ensure they are safe, I use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) along with [ethers](https://ethers.org/) to thoroughly test and deploy smart contract onto the blockchain.

### Web

I build [<Nodedotjs /> Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) APIs using [<Nextdotjs /> Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) API routes. I use [<Typescript /> TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) everywhere I can to guarantee type safety and prevent runtime errors.

## Some Experience:

I can also build an API with [<Express /> Express](https://expressjs.com/) if necessary.

## Plan On Learning:

- [<Foundry /> Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- [<Prisma /> Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [<Trpc /> tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [<Rust /> Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [<Bun /> Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [<Deno /> Deno](https://deno.land/)
