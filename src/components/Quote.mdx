> Damn Vulnerable DeFi is, and forever will be, an educational resource for the community. It is intended to be a safe playground to train security researchers that will help protect Ethereum applications. In solving these challenges, you may learn how to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. They might resemble the ones you’ll uncover during your own research of contracts in production. If that’s the case, always follow each project’s responsible disclosure processes, usually via bug bounty programs or security contacts.
